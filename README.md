**Hey I'm Yofou**, but my real name is Nathan, I'm a programming enthusiast that loves to learn new things.
I work mainly on chat bot ( mainly discord & twitch ) so I work alot with public apis and if needed
web scrapping for public data. I'm also slowly learning web & game development although still fairly new
I think I'm making good progress and most of all enjoying myself.
