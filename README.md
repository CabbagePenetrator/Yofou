**Hey I'm Yofou**, but my real name is Nathan, I'm a programming enthusiast that loves to learn new things.
I mainly work on Discord & Twitch chat bots.

Currently I'm obsessed with data structures and creating fullstack applications.
These applications are usually web-based but sometimes also include native desktop and mobile apps too.

My go-to stack is Svelte (front end) and NestJS (back end) :)
